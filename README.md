# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Prediction
This problem statement describes a project focused on analysing customer-level data from a leading telecom firm to identify customers at high risk of churn. Given the high annual churn rate in the telecom industry and the cost of acquiring new customers, customer retention is crucial for incumbent operators. The objective of the project is to build predictive models that can identify customers at high risk of churn and determine the main indicators of churn. The project aims to help telecom companies reduce customer churn by predicting which customers are at high risk and implementing measures to retain them.
  In addition to analyzing customer-level data and building predictive models, this project involved experimenting with several models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and ADABoost Classifier. Hyperparameter tuning was performed to evaluate the best model for predicting customer churn. The project also focused on identifying the main indicators of churn, allowing the company to take proactive measures to retain high profitable customers. By examining the performance of different models and considering important factors affecting customer churn, this project provided valuable insights for the telecom industry to make informed business decisions.
